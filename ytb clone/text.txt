Hello there, welcome to my YouTube website clone project on Github! I have created a clone of the YouTube website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to recreate the website's design and layout with my own unique touch. You can browse through my code and provide feedback or suggestions to help me improve it. One unique feature that I added to this project is a dark mode toggle for a better user experience. I hope you enjoy going through my project and thank you for checking it out!
